# Computational-Physics-and-Astronomy-Laboratory

What's up everyone!

This here was my third assignment I did for my Computational Physics and Astronomy class (PHYS 188B). We explored the 2D Ising Model by using markov chain monte carlo to compute approximate average of physical quantities.

It was coded using Python as well as using the Jupyter Notebook. There are two files under '.py' and '.ipynb', and the '.ipynb' would be opened using Jupyter. Two more files are also provided which are in pdf format: The 'HW_Description' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform, and the 'Ising_Report' is my two-column lab report written in LaTex.

Any questions, comments, or even changes are highly appreciated! Thank you for taking the time to look at my repository!
