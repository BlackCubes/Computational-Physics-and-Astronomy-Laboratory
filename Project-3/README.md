/* ISING SWORD */

What's up everyone!

This here was my third assignment I did for class where we explored the 2D Ising Model by using markov chain monte carlo to compute approximate average of physical quantities.

It was coded using Python as well as using the Jupyter Notebook. There are two files under python file (.py) and jupyter notebook file (.ipynb). Two more files are also provided which are in pdf format: The PDF file 'HW_Description' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform, and the 'Ising_Report' is my two-column lab report written in LaTex.
