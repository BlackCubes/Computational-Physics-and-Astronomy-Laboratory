/* SPECTRAL SPOTS */

What's up everyone!

This was my fourth and last assignment for my Computational Physics and Astronomy class (PHYSICS 188B). We performed Fourier analysis on two different data sets: monthly mean sunspot numbers and cosmic ray counts over a period of 50 years from beginning of 1966 to the end of 2015. 

The sunspot numbers are provided in the file "sunspots_monthly.txt" and information about the data is given in "sunspots_info.txt." The cosmic ray counts are provided in the file "rays_monthly.txt" and information about the data is given in "rays_info.txt." Both files contain 600 data points.

It was coded using Python as well as using the Jupyter Notebook. There are two files under '.py' and '.ipynb', and the '.ipynb' would be opened using Jupyter. Two more files are also provided which are in pdf format: The 'project_4' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform, and the 'spectral_Report' is my two-column lab report written in LaTex.
