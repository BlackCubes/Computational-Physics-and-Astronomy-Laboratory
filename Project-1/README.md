# RUNGE KUTTA

What's up everyone!

This here was my first assignment I did for my Computational Physics and Astronomy class (PHYS 188B). We explored a few numerical methods for solving ODEs which implements under the category of Runge-Kutta (RK) methods and symplectic methods, and analyzed famous equations in physics.

It was coded using Python as well as using the Jupyter Notebook. There are two files under python file (.py) and jupyter notebook file (.ipynb). Two more files are also provided which are in pdf format: The PDF file 'project_1' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform, and the 'blackcubes_Project-1' is my one-column lab report written in LaTex.
