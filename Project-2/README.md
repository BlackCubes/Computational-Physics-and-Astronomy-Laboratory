# QUANTUM MATRIX

What's up everyone!

This here was my second assignment I did for my Computational Physics and Astronomy class (PHYS 188B). In this project, we approximately numerically diagonalized the quantum anharmonic oscillator hamiltonian using the concept of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

It was coded using Python as well as using the Jupyter Notebook. There are two files under python file (.py) and jupyter notebook file (.ipynb). Two more files are also provided which are in pdf format: The PDF file 'project_2' is the description of the homework assigment given by the instructor for the students to perform, and the 'Elias_Gutierrez_Project_2_physics-188b' is my one-column lab report written in LaTex.
